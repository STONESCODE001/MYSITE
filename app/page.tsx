I did get one customer that never ordered and my parents were surprised and happy because I put myself out there. This might probably be the best in retrospect just because it made me uncomfortable <br> Why I stopped: realized this wasn't going to be easier than I thought, it wasn't a problem I had. Nigerian e-commerce space is different because Nigerians barely have enough to spend. Can you believe we spend 80% of our income on food? It was more of a want than a need and it was ironically mine",

            I got into uni 2 months after i clocked 16 and i left 17 ( i was studying software engineering ) why you may ask, well up to that point my dad was doing all the thinking for me yes i picked my dream course tht i had in mind since i was like like 9/10 <br /> so what did i do, i tried everything but looking back now i was just so focused on making money alone, but nevertheless it drove me forward, cause i had to test out tons of my ideas out and i did learn coding form scratch all with my phone ( an itel A56 pro ) <br /> <strong> ps: i did miss tons of details and i mean a lot but yh hopefully his gives you a positive glimpise into me ( thats on you though )</strong>
